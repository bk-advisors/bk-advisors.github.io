As Uganda strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 3 i.e., to improve the health and wellbeing of the population, a crucial aspect to address is healthcare financing. While some progress has been made over the past decade, the healthcare system continues to face significant challenges e.g. limited access to quality and affordable care for millions of Ugandans. However, there are also opportunities to transform healthcare financing in Uganda into a more sustainable and equitable system. This article explores both the challenges to address and opportunities to be seized to ensure better healthcare for the people of Uganda.

## Challenges

From 2009 to 2019, Uganda's health expenditure per capita decreased from $44 to $32, a negative trend when compared to other East African neighbors. For instance, Kenya's expenditure grew from $55 to $83 during the same period, while Rwanda's increased from $45 to $51. This declining trend in Uganda’s health spending per capita, highlights the pressing need for further investment in the healthcare sector.

A second major challenge facing Uganda is the high dependency on out-of-pocket payments for healthcare services. According to the World Health Organization, out-of-pocket payments accounted for 41% of Uganda's total health expenditure in 2017, a proportion which hasn't changed much in the last 5 years. This financial burden often leads to impoverishment and limits access to essential health services, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable populations.

Take, for instance, the story of Jane, a mother of three living in a rural village in Pakwach. When her youngest child fell ill with malaria, she had to travel over 20 miles to reach the nearest health center. The cost of treatment drained her family's meager savings, forcing them to borrow money from relatives and neighbors to afford the life-saving care her child needed.

Another challenge is the inequitable distribution of healthcare resources across the country. Rural areas, which house a majority of Uganda's population, often have limited access to well-equipped health facilities and skilled healthcare professionals. This disparity further exacerbates the health inequalities experienced by Ugandans.

Consider also the story of Paul, a small-scale farmer in rural Kabale, who struggles to manage his diabetes. The nearest health facility with the capacity to monitor and treat his condition is a two-hour bus ride away. The cost of transportation, combined with the high out-of-pocket expenses for medications and tests, has left him with an impossible choice: risk his health by skipping treatments or plunge his family into debt.


## Opportunities

Despite these challenges, there are opportunities to strengthen Uganda’s healthcare financing system. Implementing policies that increase public funding for healthcare is a crucial step in reducing out-of-pocket expenses and expanding access to essential services. For instance, the government could prioritize increasing its budgetary allocation to the health sector, which currently falls short of the 15% target set by the African Union's Abuja Declaration.

Expanding health insurance coverage is another potential avenue to improve healthcare financing. By establishing a national health insurance scheme that covers a wide range of services, the government can pool resources to provide affordable, quality care to all Ugandans. This approach has been successful in countries like Rwanda, where community-based health insurance schemes have led to increased healthcare utilization and financial risk protection.

Furthermore, the government can leverage public-private partnerships (PPPs) to address gaps in healthcare infrastructure and service delivery. By engaging private sector expertise and resources, the government can stimulate investments in healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas where access is limited. PPPs can also foster innovations in healthcare delivery, such as telemedicine, which can help bridge the gap between urban and rural populations.

Last but not least, the government also has the opportunity to invest in primary healthcare, focusing on preventive and promotive interventions. Strengthening primary care can yield long-term benefits, reducing the burden on the healthcare system, improving health outcomes, and saving lives. By prioritizing primary care, the government can ensure that Ugandans receive the essential services they need to lead healthy lives.

## Call to action:

To wrap up, while Uganda faces significant challenges in healthcare financing, there are also numerous opportunities for improvement. By embracing a combination of increased public funding, expanded health insurance coverage, public-private partnerships, and investment in primary healthcare, the government can build a more equitable and sustainable healthcare system for all citizens. The time to act is now, as the health and wellbeing of our people hang in the balance.
