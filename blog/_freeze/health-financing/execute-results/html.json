My mother is retired and living a mostly peaceful existence. The kind of life you imagine when when you think of someone easing into their later years.\n\nThen came the stroke.\n\nNo warning. Just the quiet attack of two deadly enemies many don't see coming - high blood pressure and diabetes. Neither screams or shows up when you expect. However when they arrive, they demand attention you're rarely prepared to give.\n\nMy siblings and I raced up from Kampala, terrified but trying not to show it. We got her into a private clinic in Pakwach town. She was stabilized. She came home. The bill was 489,200 shillings. About $130.\n\nThat $130 is now the most important money I’ve ever spent.\n\nBut here’s the thing that won’t leave me alone: my mother survived because we had that money. Someone else’s doesn’t—because they didn’t. In Uganda, survival isn’t always about biology. It’s often about cash flow.\n\nAnd that’s a terrifying way to live.\n\n\n## **When Health Systems Fail Us**\n\nMost people think of healthcare are as a big thing. Infrastructure. Budgets. Ministries. But it’s really a small thing. It’s about whether your mother gets to come home. It’s about whether your neighbor dies quietly because they couldn’t afford their medication.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2022, Uganda’s health spending per person fell—from $55 to $44, while this same metric went up for our neighbors in Kenya ($65 to $90) and Rwanda ($57 to $77).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThat decline doesn’t show up in newspaper headlines, but it shows up in empty drug shelves, exhausted nurses, and families praying the fever breaks because they can’t afford to treat it.\n\n34% of all healthcare spending here still comes straight from people’s pockets. That hasn’t changed in years. When illness comes, so does debt. And if debt doesn’t come, death might.\n\nIn more developed countries, healthcare appears to be a well oiled system. Here, it feels like a gamble. \n\n\n## **Systems Do Exactly What They’re Designed To Do.**\n\nThe human tendency is to assume failure comes from chaos or neglect. But most of the time, systems work the way they were built. If the healthcare system leaves people behind, it’s because that’s how we’ve chosen—passively or otherwise—for it to operate.\n\nBut here’s the hopeful part: anything built can be rebuilt.\n\nWe could:\n\n- **Double down on prevention.** High blood pressure and high sugar don’t need to be death sentences. Screen early. Educate better. These are boring interventions—until they save someone you love.\n\n- **Align incentives.** Since its people that make decisions about how resources are allocated, and these specific people (political leaders and leaders of industry) will only change if they are incentivized. Simply put, government policy decisions and resource allocations are based more on political and economic incentives than social incentives, hence they three will need to be strategically aligned.\n    \n- **Honor our promises.** We committed to spending 15% of the national budget on health under the Abuja Declaration. We never got close. But money is policy. Where you spend is what you value and prioritize.\n\n    \n- **Learn from Rwanda.** Their national health insurance works. Ours doesn’t exist. Theirs proves it can be done. The only difference is execution.\n    \n\n## **What We’re Actually Talking About**\n\nThis story isn’t about my mother. It’s not even about health.\n\nIt’s about dignity. It’s about whether a nation believes that the poor deserve to live as much as the rich. It’s about the difference between survival and fairness.\n\nNo one in Uganda is asking for miracles. They’re asking for the basics. And in many cases, they’re paying for those basics out of pocket—at the exact moment they’re least able to afford them.\n\nIf we wait for a perfect solution, we’ll still be waiting in ten years. But small, clear, immediate action could start rewriting this story tomorrow.\n\nMy mother lived because of $130. That number haunts me—not because it was expensive, but because, for too many people, it’s out of reach.\n\nAnd in a country like ours, that should never be the reason someone dies.\n\n## References\n\n-  https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en\n- https://www.afro.who.int/publications/who-african-region-health-expenditure-atlas-2023-0\n",
