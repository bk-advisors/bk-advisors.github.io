In my previous post, I shared a personal story to illustrate the negative impact of a failing health system. That specific example was just a microcosm of a wider issue.

Across Sub-Saharan Africa, falling sick is often a life-altering event for many of us. Families go into debt over hospital bills. Clinics lack basics like gloves, gauze and paracetamol. Preventable diseases still claim lives. But surprisingly, the region has never had more external money available to fund public health than it has received in recent decades. Its a paradox.

Between 2000 and 2022, total health expenditures as a share of GDP in most Sub-Saharan African countries **increased**, thanks primarily to sustained donor flows. Uganda, for example, receives hundreds of millions of dollars annually from the U.S. government, the Global Fund, Gavi, and other donors.

So, why are so many health systems still failing? I believe the key to this mystery is on the financing-side and hence I'd like to rephrase the question a little bit, and ask: Why do Sub-Saharan governments struggle to fund public health?

In this article, I premise that African governments struggle to fund public healthcare **because the current system has many points of financial leakage & displacement.**

## Money Goes In, But Health Outcomes Struggle To Come Out

In theory, African governments are committed to health. The Abuja Declaration of 2001 asked countries to allocate 15% of their national budgets to health and they all promised to do this. In reality, only a few ever did, and most spend only 5–8% of the annual government budget on health.

When I dug into the existing research and available data, the underlying issues became clearer and seem to stem from 4 key drivers :

1.  **The “substitution effect”:** A phenomenon where government budget allocations to public health tend to shrink as donor/external aid increases

2.  **Competing fiscal policy priorities** lead to debt servicing and military spending taking priority over the national health budget

3.  **A regressive tax collection system** that protects the wealthy and disproportionately burden the poor

4.  **Corruption** drains national coffers through procurement and payroll systems fraud

Each of these drivers bleeds the system, not in isolation - but **as an ecosystem of specific points of failure**.

Let's dive into each one, and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
