In my previous post, I shared a personal story to illustrate the negative impact of a failing health system. That specific example was just a microcosm of a wider issue.

Across Sub-Saharan Africa, falling sick is often a life-altering event for many of us. Families go into debt over hospital bills. Clinics lack basics like gloves, gauze and paracetamol. Preventable diseases still claim lives. But surprisingly, the region has never had more external money available to fund public health than it has received in recent decades. Its a paradox.

Between 2000 and 2022, total health expenditures as a share of GDP in most Sub-Saharan African countries **increased**, thanks primarily to sustained donor flows. Uganda, for example, receives hundreds of millions of dollars annually from the U.S. government, the Global Fund, Gavi, and other donors.

So why are so many health systems still failing?

The answer: **They are failing because the system is poorly designed and has many points of financial leakage & displacement.**

## Money Goes In, But Health Outcomes Don't Come Out

In theory, African governments are committed to health. The Abuja Declaration of 2001 asked countries to allocate 15% of their national budgets to health and they all promised to do this. In reality, Only a few ever did, and most spend between 5–8% of the annual government budget on health.

Meanwhile, donor aid for health continues to pour in and this creates the illusion of progress which must be debunked. When I dug into the existing research and numbers, the problem became clearer and stems from 5 key drivers:

1.  **The “substitution effect”:** Government budget allocations to health shrink as aid increases

2.  **Debt repayments** take priority over health budgets

3.  **Military spending** expands quietly to shield the political elite, shielded from scrutiny

4.  **Tax collection is regressive**, protecting the wealthy and burdening the poor

5.  **Corruption** drains national coffers through procurement and payroll systems fraud

Each of these drivers bleeds the system, not in isolation - but **as an ecosystem of different points of failure**.
