    "text": "As an organisation or entity, the thought of first time funding from a donor can be both exciting and a little scary at the same time. However, the thought of how to effectively manage that grant, the people and systems you have in place could raise a few questions or concerns. One might wonder, how best can we deliver on this grant? How can we deliver quality outputs as per the agreement, whilst ensuring the donor is happy with accountability and regularly updated on progress? All these questions and concerns can be addressed by putting in place a few key processes, practices and systems."

This meeting should bring together staff from all the relevant departments, with the aim of familiarising with the grant agreement, discussing the expectations, dos and don’t with regards to the project. During this meeting, functions like programme, M&E, HR and finance are able to know what role they play for project success to be achieved. The compliance and reporting requirements should be adequately discussed to ensure understanding by all the different departments."

In many cases, the templates are shared by the donor and they have clear guidance and description on what information is expected in certain sections, for instance key activities during the reporting period, achievements, challenges and lessons learnt. It is also important to take note of issues like word and character limits so as to keep the information within the donor’s requirements."

The important documentation pertaining to a project should be easily accessible by the project team members. An organisation can think of either having a centralised location or drive that can be used to store all relevant information pertaining to the project, right from grant agreements, reports, and communication or visibility materials.\nThe documentation of key activities as and when they happen, so that once a report is required, there is already something in draft state. This also makes it easier to recall events when they have just taken place and everything is fresh as opposed to waiting to burn the midnight oil many months down the road with pressing deadlines."

    "text": "As Uganda strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 3 i.e., to improve the health and wellbeing of the population, a crucial aspect to address is healthcare financing. While some progress has been made over the past decade, the healthcare system continues to face significant challenges e.g. limited access to quality and affordable care for millions of Ugandans. However, there are also opportunities to transform healthcare financing in Uganda into a more sustainable and equitable system. This article explores both the challenges to address and opportunities to be seized to ensure better healthcare for the people of Uganda."

    "section": "Challenges",
    "text": "Challenges\nFrom 2009 to 2019, Uganda’s health expenditure per capita decreased from $44 to $32, a negative trend when compared to other East African neighbors. For instance, Kenya’s expenditure grew from $55 to $83 during the same period, while Rwanda’s increased from $45 to $51. This declining trend in Uganda’s health spending per capita, highlights the pressing need for further investment in the healthcare sector.\nA second major challenge facing Uganda is the high dependency on out-of-pocket payments for healthcare services. According to the World Health Organization, out-of-pocket payments accounted for 41% of Uganda’s total health expenditure in 2017, a proportion which hasn’t changed much in the last 5 years. This financial burden often leads to impoverishment and limits access to essential health services, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable populations.\nTake, for instance, the story of Jane, a mother of three living in a rural village in Pakwach. When her youngest child fell ill with malaria, she had to travel over 20 miles to reach the nearest health center. The cost of treatment drained her family’s meager savings, forcing them to borrow money from relatives and neighbors to afford the life-saving care her child needed.\nAnother challenge is the inequitable distribution of healthcare resources across the country. Rural areas, which house a majority of Uganda’s population, often have limited access to well-equipped health facilities and skilled healthcare professionals. This disparity further exacerbates the health inequalities experienced by Ugandans.\nConsider also the story of Paul, a small-scale farmer in rural Kabale, who struggles to manage his diabetes. The nearest health facility with the capacity to monitor and treat his condition is a two-hour bus ride away. The cost of transportation, combined with the high out-of-pocket expenses for medications and tests, has left him with an impossible choice: risk his health by skipping treatments or plunge his family into debt."

    "section": "Opportunities",
    "text": "Opportunities\nDespite these challenges, there are opportunities to strengthen Uganda’s healthcare financing system. Implementing policies that increase public funding for healthcare is a crucial step in reducing out-of-pocket expenses and expanding access to essential services. For instance, the government could prioritize increasing its budgetary allocation to the health sector, which currently falls short of the 15% target set by the African Union’s Abuja Declaration.\nExpanding health insurance coverage is another potential avenue to improve healthcare financing. By establishing a national health insurance scheme that covers a wide range of services, the government can pool resources to provide affordable, quality care to all Ugandans. This approach has been successful in countries like Rwanda, where community-based health insurance schemes have led to increased healthcare utilization and financial risk protection.\nFurthermore, the government can leverage public-private partnerships (PPPs) to address gaps in healthcare infrastructure and service delivery. By engaging private sector expertise and resources, the government can stimulate investments in healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas where access is limited. PPPs can also foster innovations in healthcare delivery, such as telemedicine, which can help bridge the gap between urban and rural populations.\nLast but not least, the government also has the opportunity to invest in primary healthcare, focusing on preventive and promotive interventions. Strengthening primary care can yield long-term benefits, reducing the burden on the healthcare system, improving health outcomes, and saving lives. By prioritizing primary care, the government can ensure that Ugandans receive the essential services they need to lead healthy lives."

The time to act is now, as the health and wellbeing of our people hang in the balance."
