## The Spark of Curiosity

There's probably something many don't know about me; I have a peculiar past-time or hobby, if you like.

Whenever I come across a new idea or hypothesis or theory - I try to look for available data to test it, just out of curiosity, to see the limits of the theory or edge cases.

Same it true for the "displacement effect", which I wrote about this week on Linkedin.

In this more technical post, I'll walk you through my analysis of the WHO GHED (Global Health Expenditure Data) from 2000 to 2022 to test the claim I made in the article, that:

>  *"an increase is funding to public health from external donors, leads to the government spending less on public health."*

## The Core Question

The core question I'll be asking is this:

> “If donors give more money to a country’s health budget one year, does the government spend less of its own money the next year?”

Like I mentioned in my article, its kind of like if your child received a partial scholarship as a contribution to their school fees, for say good performance, but instead of stepping up as a parent and paying the balance - you instead stop paying school fees altogether and use the money you had to buy the new iPhone.\

That’s the **displacement effect,** in a nutshell i.e. when outside help replaces rather than adds to your own domestic efforts.

## **The Dataset**

From WHO’s Global Health Expenditure Database for 6 East African countries (2012–2022), we use:

-   **Government health spending per person** (money from the country itself)

-   **External health spending per person** (money from donors and aid agencies).

## **The Analysis Steps**

The R code does three big things:

1.   **Prepares the data**

    -   Picks the countries and years we care about

    -   Calculates **year-to-year changes** in government spending.\
        (Example: If 2020 gov’t spend was \$55 and 2019 was \$50 → change = +\$5.)

    -   Records **last year’s donor spending** for each year (the “lag”)

2.   **Runs a regression model**

    -   Compares each country **to itself** over time (this removes differences between countries).

    -   Looks at the relationship between **last year’s donor funding** and **this year’s change in gov’t spending**.

        -   If the result is **negative**, it suggests a displacement effect.

3.   **Makes visualizations** to see the patterns.

## **The Results and How to Read Them**

### **A. The Regression Table**

-    **Key number (beta)** = how much government spending changes when donor money goes up by \$1 per person (from the year before).

-   **If beta is negative** (e.g., -0.40), it means:\
    *For every extra \$1 per person from donors, government spending drops by 40 cents the next year.*

-   **Confidence interval** shows the range we’re fairly sure the true effect is in.

### **B. Country-Specific Slopes (Visualization)** 

-    Each country gets its own “beta” line showing how its gov’t spending reacts to donor funding.

-    If the dot is left of zero → displacement effect.

-   If the dot is right of zero → no displacement (donor funds seem to add to gov’t funds).

## **How to Interpret**

-    **Negative relationship = displacement:** government spending drops when donors give more.

-   **Positive relationship = crowding in:** donor funds encourage governments to also spend more.

-   This isn’t about “good” or “bad” - it’s about understanding **how funding systems react** so policies can be designed better.
